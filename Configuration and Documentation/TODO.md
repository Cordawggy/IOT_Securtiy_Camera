# TO-DO's
## Note down anything that needs doing, including decisions, hardware work needed, backend/frontend code needed, or elements of an ongoing sprint. Leave a timestamp and mark who is leaving what note.    Check back often for new to-do's.

### CORY

#### We really, really, need that camera working. Me, Andrew and Bradley have so much catching up to do it's frankly ridiculous, and if we can't get the camera sorted we don't know where to start. This needs to get done ASAP, like seriously ASAP.

### ANDREW
##### Nick to Andrew | 2025/02/16 3:59am
#### Once the camera is setup, work with Cory to get a video feed online. Once that's been done we (Andrew Nick Bradley) can link up over discord and work towards outputting the video somehow or setting up some processing mechanism. I wont lie it's gonna take some late nights to make up for lost time with the hardware elements.

### NICK

### BRADLEY
##### Nick to Bradley | 2025/02/16 4:02am
#### Read Andrew's todo, you are mentioned. + Once we can process the video, I need to work on a motion detection algorithm so we can get to work on processing the raw video into time-series data/logs.

### FELIX
##### Nick to Felix | 2025/02/16 4:03am
#### Once the video-out and data transfer to database are working, ensure it meets basic data safety regulations/find data safety regulations we need to / should adhere to.

### WE HAVE WEEKS TO CATCH UP ON, HARDWARE NEEDS TO BE DONE ASAP.

### Andrew to Group | 2025/02/21 

### As much as i would love to have the reading week to relax, this is the week that we are going to need to push and get things sorted out with this camera. If we can lock in for this reading week and catch up and get our stuff together. We could be fine but it's start ASAP. One more semester guys let's lock in.
