# Video Processing, Object Detection using PyTorch and OpenCV

## Utilities
### OpenCV
This project uses the OpenCV library to do image analysis and object recognition
### Custom PyTorch Model
This project also takes advantage of PyTorch's neural network libraries, its optim, timm, dataset analysis and dataloader libraries; to facilitate the real-time processing of video feed.
### FiftyOne Dataset Zoo
I will be importing FiftyOne to import Microsoft's COCO2017 Common Object in Context, which is a library of ~123k images for training the PyTorch model.
## Objectives
### Real-Time analysis of video feed
One of the mandatory elements of our project is live video object detection.
### Time-stamped markers of anomalies and events
Further, the detected objects should create event markers and return them to a database.
